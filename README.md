## Functional
This repo contains documents storage application interface contract specifications. This has been made as separate repo as it makes it easier to include in the storage implemenation module.

Idea here is to define a common interface contract for various underlying storage implementation. Examples of underlying storage backends are AWS S3, GCP object store, Azure Object Store etc.
